## Overview
Frontend mentor is a great companion for learning web development. This challenge was TRICKY as it was my first time building a full stack app and i didnt had the figma or sketch files but im happy that i could make it as realistic as possible.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- store their todos in local storage



## My process
I first went on to design my own mockup of the design using figma and then built the project.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Java script

### What I learned
I understood vanilla js very well while creating this project.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for buildin the mockup . I really liked this pattern of building mockups first and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand the vanilla js.
